Some of them I can remember are:

1. A webapp for scheduling appointments - it allows registered members to schedule appointments on free courts. Right now it is used by a tennis club, but it can be adjusted to fit any other sport. The price is dynamically generated based on given rules and triggers.

2. Odmorite.com - a website used to advertise vacation destinations.

3. Electronic bell - a small webapp deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a relay. The server allows remote bell activation, and creation of various profiles to fit any schedule the school or an institution with similar needs is following.

4. Class schedule generator - it was created for an elementary school, and can create a class schedule based on a list of departments, classes, teachers and their needs. It doesn't support grouping of multiple departments for one class, and the generated schedule isn't always perfect, but the master schedule can be edited with real time support in terms of error reports and bad results.

5. A web app and an Android app for partial automation of risk assessment at a workplace.
